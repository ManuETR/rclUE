## Online documentation

https://rclUE.readthedocs.io/en/devel/

Please download UE5.1 for Linux by following [Unreal Engine for Linux](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux)

# rclUE and ROS2

## Description

- We use ros2 'foxy' lightweighted (not all binaries are included). Source/ThirdParty/ros folder is fully autogenerated by [UE_tools](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools)
- ros includes [UE_msgs](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_msgs)
- UE uses centimeters but ROS uses meters. Please convert manually or use [URRConversionUtils](https://rapyutasimulationplugins.readthedocs.io/en/devel/doxygen_generated/html/d4/dc1/class_u_r_r_conversion_utils.html) in [RapyutaSimulationPlugins](https://rapyutasimulationplugins.readthedocs.io/en/devel/index.html)
- within the Unreal Editor: Edit->Plugins, search and enable for `rclc`

## Windows is currently unsupported

# Getting Started

The plugin folder contains a video "Example_BP_PubSub.mp4" demonstrating how to setup a PubSub example in Blueprint.

An example setup using this plugin can be found at [turtlebot3-UE](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE)

# Notes on working with ROS 2 and UE

- rcl and void\* types cannot be managed by UE (no UPROPERTY) and therefore can't be used directly in Blueprint. Whenever access to these variables is needed, the user should write a class to wrap it and all of their handling must be done in C++.
- some basic numerical types are not natively supported in Blueprint (e.g. double, unsigned int). In order to use these, a workaround is needed (a plugin implementing those types for BP, a modified UE or a custom implementation).
- In autogenerated messages, the method MsgToString() should be implemented by the user as its current purpose is to help debugging.

# How to update ROS inside RclUE

Currently there is a scripts in [UE_tools](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools) to automatically build and update ROS2 libraries. Please follow [steps](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools#general-usage)
